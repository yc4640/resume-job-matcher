# Ranking Configuration for Job-Resume Matching (M3)
# Adjust these weights to change ranking strategy without modifying code

# Feature Weights for Final Score Calculation
# Formula: final_score = w1*embedding_score + w2*skill_overlap + w3*keyword_bonus - w4*gap_penalty
weights:
  # Weight for semantic similarity from embeddings (0-1 range)
  embedding: 0.4

  # Weight for skill overlap ratio (0-1 range)
  skill_overlap: 0.3

  # Weight for keyword bonus (count-based, normalized)
  keyword_bonus: 0.2

  # Weight for gap penalty (count-based, normalized)
  gap_penalty: 0.1

# Keyword Configuration
keywords:
  # High-priority keywords that give bonus points when matched
  high_priority:
    - "Python"
    - "Machine Learning"
    - "Deep Learning"
    - "LLM"
    - "NLP"
    - "Recommendation Systems"
    - "Search"
    - "Distributed Systems"

  # Bonus multiplier for high-priority keyword matches
  high_priority_multiplier: 1.5

# Gap Penalty Configuration
gap_penalty:
  # Critical skills that severely penalize if missing
  critical_skills:
    - "Python"
    - "SQL"

  # Penalty multiplier for missing critical skills
  critical_penalty_multiplier: 2.0

# Normalization Settings
normalization:
  # Maximum number of keywords to consider for normalization
  max_keywords: 10

  # Maximum number of gaps to consider for normalization
  max_gaps: 10

# Feature Display Settings
display:
  # Show detailed feature breakdown in response
  show_features: true

  # Show explanation for top recommendation
  show_explanation: true
